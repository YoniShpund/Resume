# Resume

*A simple Jekyll + GitHub Pages powered resume.*

### Customizing

First you'll want to fork the repo to your own account. Then clone it locally and customize, or use the GitHub web editor to customize.

#### Options/Configuration

Most of the customization will take place in the `_config.yml` file. Here is a list of customizations available via `_config.yml`:
- title
- resume_name
- resume_title

#### Editing content

Most of the content configuration will take place in the `/_layouts/resume.html` file. Simply edit the HTML file accordingly.

### Publishing to GitHub Pages for free

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) will host this for free with your GitHub account. Just make sure you're using a `gh-pages` branch, and the site will automatically be available at `<yourusername>.github.io/Resume`. You can also add a CNAME if you want it to be available at a custom domain...

### Configuring with your own domain name

To setup your GH Pages site with a custom domain, [follow the instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) on the GitHub Help site for that topic.
